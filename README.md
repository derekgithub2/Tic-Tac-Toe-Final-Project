### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
This web application is a game of TicTacToe written in JavaScript. Players can type their names in the respective input fields and play multiple rounds of TicTacToe. The wins of each player are displayed on the screen throughout the game. 

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
1. Clone the SSH code from this [link](https://github.com/derekgithub2) to your local computer
2. Open in your text editor 
3. Read the README.md 
4. In the terminal, run the command `open index.html` for initial deployment and interaction with the app

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
I am a module 1 student at Turing School of Software and Design. Over the course of one week, I spent approximately 15-20 hours on this project. 

### Contributors:

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
- Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
    - DRY JavaScript
    - event delegation to handle similar event listeners
- Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
- Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
- Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
##### Wins
- I was able to work through the logic required to get my game to function correctly. 
- I made sure the data was updated before the changes were reflected in the DOM. I did this by playing through the game in my Terminal before reflecting the changes on my web app. 

##### Challenges
- I struggled with styling and making touching up the presentation through visual features. I got some inspiration and help from other members of my cohort and was able to complete the styling challenges I came across.
